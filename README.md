# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview
The project is based in the data collection of the employees who could serve as tutors for the next generation of workers, as there is a lot of retirement-eligible employees in the close future, the company wants to prepare the welcoming and training of new fellows. By determining the amount of people soon to retirement and retrieveing the contact information from the dataset, the "silver tsunami" could be a more planned strategy.

To make this first chart, it's needed to filter and sort the data to get how many people with retirement eligibility we are talking about. Filtering on date to check on the employees that could meet certain criteria, evaluating the ones born between 1952 and 1955 and that are still current employees. It can be seen the following:
